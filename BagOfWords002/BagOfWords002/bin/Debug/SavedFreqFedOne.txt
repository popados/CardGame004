is
more

well
worthy

whether
it

conduce
more

that
they

to

purposes,

divide
themselves

separate
confederacies,

give

of

the

of
powers
which
they
are

to

in

national
government.

into
and
to
the
of
the
of

are
to

It
has
until
lately
been
a
received
and
uncontradicted
opinion
that
the
prosperity
of
the
people
of
America
depended
on
their
continuing
firmly
united,
and
the
wishes,
prayers,
and
efforts
of
our
best
and
wisest
citizens
have
been
constantly
directed
to
that
object.
But
politicians
now
appear,
who
insist
that
this
opinion
is
erroneous,
and
that
instead
of
looking
for
safety
and
happiness
in
union,
we
ought
to
seek
it
in
a
division
of
the
States
into
distinct
confederacies
or
sovereignties.
However
extraordinary
this
new
doctrine
may
appear,
it
nevertheless
has
its
advocates;
and
certain
characters
who
were
much
opposed
to
it
formerly,
are
at
present
of
the
number.
Whatever
may
be
the
arguments
or
inducements
which
have
wrought
this
change
in
the
sentiments
and
declarations
of
these
gentlemen,
it
certainly
would
not
be
wise
in
the
people
at
large
to
adopt
these
new
political
tenets
without
being
fully
convinced
that
they
are
founded
in
truth
and
sound
policy.

that

fertile,
wide-spreading
country

the
portion
of
our
western
sons
of
liberty.
Providence
has
in
a
particular
manner
blessed
it
with
a
variety
of
soils
and
productions,
and
watered
it
with
innumerable
streams,
for
the
delight
and
accommodation
of
its
inhabitants.
A
succession
of
navigable
waters
forms
a
kind
of
chain
round
its
borders,

if
to
bind
it

the
most
noble
rivers
in
the
world,
running
at
convenient
distances,
present
them
with
highways
for

easy
communication
of

exchange
of

strong
sense

induced
the
people,
at

to
institute
a

to
preserve

it.

formed
it
almost
as
soon
as
they
had
a
political
existence;
nay,
at
a
time
when
their
habitations
were
in
flames,
when
many
of
their
citizens
were
bleeding,
and
when
the
progress
of
hostility
and
desolation
left
little
room
for
those
calm
and
mature
inquiries
and
reflections
which
must
ever
precede
the
formation
of
a
wise
and
well-balanced
government
for
a
free
people.
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
at,
that
a
government
instituted
in
times
so
inauspicious,
should
on
experiment
be
found
greatly
deficient

inadequate

it

that
it

neither

to

to
that
sedate
and
candid
consideration
which
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
subject
demand,
and
which
it
certainly
ought
to
receive.
But
this
(as
was
remarked
in
the
foregoing
number
of
this
paper)
is
more
to
be
wished
than
expected,
that
it
may
be
so
considered
and
examined.
Experience
on
a
former
occasion
teaches
us
not
to
be
too
sanguine
in
such
hopes.
It
is
not
yet
forgotten
that
well-grounded
apprehensions
of
imminent
danger
induced
the
people
of
America
to
form
the
memorable
Congress
of
1774.
That
body
recommended
certain
measures
to
their
constituents,
and
the
event
proved
their
wisdom;
yet
it
is
fresh
in
our
memories
how
soon
the
press
began
to
teem
with
pamphlets
and
weekly
papers
against
those
very
measures.
Not
only
many
of
the
officers
of
government,
who
obeyed
the
dictates
of
personal
interest,
but
others,
from
a
mistaken
estimate
of
consequences,
or
the
undue
influence
of
former
attachments,
or
whose
ambition
aimed
at
objects
which
did
not
correspond
with
the
public
good,
were
indefatigable
in
their
efforts
to
persuade
the
people
to
reject
the
advice
of
that
patriotic
Congress.
Many,
indeed,
were
deceived
and
deluded,
but
the
great
majority
of
the
people
reasoned
and
decided
judiciously;
and
happy
they
are
in
reflecting
that
they
did
so.

It
is
worthy
of
remark
that
not
only
the
first,
but
every
succeeding
Congress,
as
well
as
the
late
convention,
have
invariably
joined
with
the
people
in
thinking
that
the
prosperity
of
America
depended
on
its
Union.
To
preserve
and
perpetuate
it
was
the
great
object
of
the
people
in
forming
that
convention,
and
it
is
also
the
great
object
of
the
plan
which
the
convention
has
advised
them
to
adopt.
With
what
propriety,
therefore,
or
for
what
good
purposes,
are
attempts
at
this
particular
period
made
by
some
men
to
depreciate
the
importance
of
the
Union?
Or
why
is
it
suggested
that
three
or
four
confederacies
would
be
better
than
one?
I
am
persuaded
in
my
own
mind
that
the
people
have
always
thought
right
on
this
subject,
and
that
their
universal
and
uniform
attachment
to
the
cause
of
the
Union
rests
on
great
and
weighty
reasons,
which
I
shall
endeavor
to
develop
and
explain
in
some
ensuing
papers.
They
who
promote
the
idea
of
substituting
a
number
of
distinct
confederacies
in
the
room
of
the
plan
of
the
convention,
seem
clearly
to
foresee
that
the
rejection
of
it
would
put
the
continuance
of
the
Union
in
the
utmost
jeopardy.
That
certainly
would
be
the
case,
and
I
sincerely
wish
that
it
may
be
as
clearly
foreseen
by
every
good
citizen,
that
whenever
the
dissolution
of
the
Union
arrives,
America
will
have
reason
to
exclaim,
in
the
words
of
the
poet:
"FAREWELL!
A
LONG
FAREWELL
TO
ALL
MY
GREATNESS."

It
is
too
true,
however
disgraceful
it
may
be
to
human
nature,
that
nations
in
general
will
make
war
whenever
they
have
a
prospect
of
getting
anything
by
it;
nay,
absolute
monarchs
will
often
make
war
when
their
nations
are
to
get
nothing
by
it,
but
for
the
purposes
and
objects
merely
personal,
such
as
thirst
for
military
glory,
revenge
for
personal
affronts,
ambition,
or
private
compacts
to
aggrandize
or
support
their
particular
families
or
partisans.
These
and
a
variety
of
other
motives,
which
affect
only
the
mind
of
the
sovereign,
often
lead
him
to
engage
in
wars
not
sanctified
by
justice
or
the
voice
and
interests
of
his
people.
But,
independent
of
these
inducements
to
war,
which
are
more
prevalent
in
absolute
monarchies,
but
which
well
deserve
our
attention,
there
are
others
which
affect
nations
as
often
as
kings;
and
some
of
them
will
on
examination
be
found
to
grow
out
of
our
relative

If

was

would
the
others
fly
to

succor,

spend
their
blood
and
money
in

defense?

specious

seduced
by
a

great
fondness

to
decline

of

perhaps
they
have
been
jealous,
and
whose
importance
they

content

diminished?
Although
such
conduct
would
not
be
wise,
it
would,
nevertheless,
be
natural.

certain
it
is,
that
foreign
nations
will
know
and
view
it
exactly
as
it
is;
and
they
will
act
toward
us
accordingly.
If
they
see
that
our

is
efficient
and
well
administered,
our
trade
prudently
regulated,
our
militia
properly
organized
and
disciplined,
our

finances
discreetly
managed,
our
credit
re-established,
our
people
free,
contented,
and
united,
they
will
be
much
more
disposed
to
cultivate
our
friendship
than
provoke
our
resentment.

either
destitute
of

effectual

State
doing
right

wrong,

convenient),

three

discordant
republics

inclining

another
to
France,

a
third

perhaps
played
off
against
each
other
by
the
three,
what
a
poor,
pitiful
figure
will
America
make
in
their
eyes!
How
liable
would
she
become
not
only
to
their
contempt
but
to
their
outrage,
and
how
soon
would
dear-bought
experience
proclaim
that
when
a
people
or
family
so
divide,
it
never
fails
to
be
against
themselves.

the
of
the
of
QUEEN
ANNE,
in
her
letter
of
the
1st
July,
1706,
to
the
Scotch
Parliament,
makes
some
observations
on
the
importance
of
the
UNION
then
forming
between
England
and
Scotland,
which
merit
our
attention.
I
shall
present
the
public
with
one
or
two
extracts
from
it:
"An
entire
and
perfect
union
will
be
the
solid
foundation
of
lasting
peace:
It
will
secure
your
religion,
liberty,
and
property;
remove
the
animosities
amongst
yourselves,
and
the
jealousies
and
differences
betwixt
our
two
kingdoms.
It
must
increase
your
strength,
riches,
and
trade;
and
by
this
union
the
whole
island,
being
joined
in
affection
and
free
from
all
apprehensions
of
different
interest,
will
be
ENABLED
TO
RESIST
ALL
ITS
ENEMIES."
"We
most
earnestly
recommend
to
you
calmness
and
unanimity
in
this
great
and
weighty
affair,
that
the
union
may
be
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion,
being
the
only
EFFECTUAL
way
to
secure
our
present
and
future
happiness,
and
disappoint
the
designs
of
our
and
your
enemies,
who
will
doubtless,
on
this
occasion,
USE
THEIR
UTMOST
ENDEAVORS
TO
PREVENT
OR
DELAY
THIS
UNION."

Nay,
it

more

that
in

in
Europe,
neighboring
nations,
acting
under
the
impulse
of
opposite
interests
and
unfriendly
passions,
would
frequently
be
found
taking
different
sides.
Considering
our
distance
from
Europe,
it
would
be
more
natural
for
these
confederacies
to
apprehend
danger
from
one
another
than
from
distant
nations,
and
therefore
that
each
of
them
should
be
more
desirous
to
guard
against
the
others
by
the
aid
of
foreign
alliances,
than
to
guard
against
foreign
dangers
by
alliances
between
themselves.
And
here
let
us
not
forget
how
much
more
easy
it
is
to
receive
foreign
fleets
into
our
ports,
and
foreign
armies
into
our
country,
than
it
is
to
persuade
or
compel
them
to
depart.

many

the
Romans

THE
three

numbers
of
this
paper
have
been
dedicated
to
an
enumeration
of
the
dangers
to
which
we
should
be
exposed,
in
a
state
of
disunion,
from
the
arms
and

of
foreign
nations.
I
shall
now
proceed
to
delineate
dangers
of
a
different
and,
perhaps,
still
more
alarming
kind�those
which
will
in
all
probability
flow
from
dissensions
between
the
States
themselves,
and
from
domestic
factions
and
convulsions.
These
have
been
already
in
some
instances
slightly
anticipated;
but
they
deserve
a
more
particular
and
more
full
investigation.

The
causes
of
hostility
among
nations
are
innumerable.
There
are
some
which
have
a
general
and
almost
constant
operation
upon
the
collective
bodies
of
society.
Of
this
description
are
the
love
of
power
or
the
desire
of
pre-eminence
and
dominion�the
jealousy
of
power,
or
the
desire
of
equality
and
safety.
There
are
others
which
have
a
more
circumscribed
though
an
equally
operative
influence
within
their
spheres.
Such
are
the
rivalships
and
competitions
of
commerce
between
commercial
nations.
And
there
are
others,
not
less
numerous
than
either
of
the
former,
which
take
their
origin
entirely
in
private
passions;
in
the
attachments,
enmities,
interests,
hopes,
and
fears
of
leading
individuals
in
the
communities
of
which
they
are
members.
Men
of
this
class,
whether
the
favorites
of
a
king
or
of
a
people,
have
in
too
many
instances
abused
the
confidence
they
possessed;
and
assuming
the
pretext
of
some
public
motive,
have
not
scrupled
to
sacrifice
the
national
tranquillity
to
personal
advantage
or
personal
gratification.

The
ambitious
cardinal,
who
was
prime
minister
to
Henry
VIII.,
permitting
his
vanity
to
aspire
to
the
triple
crown,(5)
entertained
hopes
of
succeeding
in
the
acquisition
of
that
splendid
prize
by
the
influence
of
the
Emperor
Charles
V.
To
secure
the
favor
and
interest
of
this
enterprising
and
powerful
monarch,
he
precipitated
England
into
a
war
with
France,
contrary
to
the
plainest
dictates
of
policy,
and
at
the
hazard
of
the
safety
and
independence,
as
well
of
the
kingdom
over
which
he
presided
by
his
counsels,
as
of
Europe
in
general.
For
if
there
ever
was
a
sovereign
who
bid
fair
to
realize
the
project
of
universal
monarchy,
it
was
the
Emperor
Charles
V.,
of
whose
intrigues
Wolsey
was
at

the
instrument
and
the
dupe.

Is
it
not
(we
may
ask
these
projectors
in
politics)
the
true
interest
of
all
nations
to
cultivate
the
same
benevolent
and
philosophic
spirit?
If
this
be
their
true
interest,
have
they
in
fact
pursued
it?
Has
it
not,
on
the
contrary,
invariably
been
found
that
momentary
passions,
and
immediate
interest,
have
a
more
active
and
imperious
control
over
human
conduct
than
general
or
remote
considerations
of
policy,
utility
or
justice?
Have
republics
in
practice
been
less
addicted
to
war
than
monarchies?
Are
not
the
former
administered
by
MEN
as
well
as
the
latter?
Are
there
not
aversions,
predilections,
rivalships,
and
desires
of
unjust
acquisitions,
that
affect
nations
as
well
as
kings?
Are
not
popular
assemblies
frequently
subject
to
the
impulses
of
rage,
resentment,
jealousy,
avarice,
and
of
other
irregular
and
violent
propensities?
Is
it
not
well
known
that
their
determinations
are
often
governed
by
a
few
individuals
in
whom
they
place
confidence,
and
are,
of
course,
liable
to
be
tinctured
by
the
passions
and
views
of
those
individuals?
Has
commerce
hitherto
done
anything
more
than
change
the
objects
of
war?
Is
not
the
love
of
wealth
as
domineering
and
enterprising
a
passion
as
that
of
power
or
glory?
Have
there
not
been
as
many
wars
founded
upon
commercial
motives
since
that
has
become
the
prevailing
system
of
nations,
as
were
before
occasioned
by
the
cupidity
of
territory
or
dominion?
Has
not
the
spirit
of
commerce,
in
many
instances,
administered
new
incentives
to
the
appetite,
both
for
the
one
and
for

The
last
war
but
between
Britain
and
Spain
sprang
from
the
attempts
of
the
British
merchants
to
prosecute
an
illicit
trade
with
the
Spanish
main.
These
unjustifiable
practices
on
their
part
produced
severity
on
the
part
of
the
Spaniards
toward
the
subjects
of
Great
Britain
which
were
not
more
justifiable,
because
they
exceeded
the
bounds
of
a
just
retaliation
and
were
chargeable
with
inhumanity
and
cruelty.
Many
of
the
English
who
were
taken
on
the
Spanish
coast
were
sent
to
dig
in
the
mines
of
Potosi;
and
by
the
usual
progress
of
a
spirit
of
resentment,
the
innocent
were,
after
a
while,
confounded
with
the
guilty
in
indiscriminate
punishment.
The
complaints
of
the
merchants
kindled
a
violent
flame
throughout
the
nation,
which
soon
after
broke
out
in
the
House
of
Commons,
and
was
communicated
from
that
body
to
the
ministry.
Letters
of
reprisal
were
granted,
and
a
war
ensued,
which
in
its
consequences
overthrew
all
the
alliances

years

formed

From
this
summary
of
what
has
taken

in
other
countries,
whose

have
borne
the
nearest
resemblance
to
our
own,
what
reason

we

to

in

reveries
which
would
seduce
us
into
an
expectation
of
peace
and
cordiality
between
the
members
of
the
present
confederacy,
in
a
state
of
separation?
Have
we
not
already
seen
enough
of
the
fallacy
and
extravagance
of
those
idle
theories
which
have
amused
us
with
promises
of
an
exemption
from
the
imperfections,
weaknesses
and
evils
incident
to
society
in
every
shape?
Is
it
not
time
to
awake
from
the
deceitful
dream
of
a
golden
age,
and
to
adopt
as
a
practical
maxim
for
the
direction
of
our
political
conduct
that
we,
as
well
as
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
globe,
are
yet
remote
from
the
happy
empire
of
perfect
wisdom
and
perfect
virtue?

our

in

that
it
has
from
long

progress
of
society
become
a
sort
of
axiom
in
politics,
that
vicinity
or
nearness
of
situation,
constitutes
nations
natural
enemies.
An
intelligent
writer
expresses
himself
on
this
subject
to
this
effect:
"NEIGHBORING
NATIONS
(says
he)
are
naturally
enemies
of
each

unless
their
common
weakness
forces
them
to
league
in
a
CONFEDERATE
REPUBLIC,
and
their
constitution
prevents
the
differences

occasions,
extinguishing
that
secret
jealousy
which
disposes
all
states
to
aggrandize
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
neighbors."(11)

IS
sometimes
asked,
with
an
air
of
seeming
triumph,
what
inducements
could
the

have,
if
disunited,
to

war
upon

It
would
be
a
full
answer
to
this
question
to
say�precisely
the
same
inducements
which
have,
at
different
times,
deluged
in
blood
all
the
nations
in
the
world.
But,
unfortunately
for
us,
the
question
admits
of
a
more
particular
answer.
There
are
causes
of
differences
within
our
immediate
contemplation,
of
the
tendency
of
which,
even
under
the
restraints
of
a
federal
constitution,
we
have
had
sufficient
experience
to
enable
us
to
form
a
judgment
of
what
might
be
expected
if
those
restraints
were
removed.

Territorial
disputes
have
at
all
times
been
found
one
of
the
most
fertile
sources
of
hostility
among
nations.
Perhaps
the
greatest
proportion
of
wars
that
have
desolated
the
earth
have
sprung
from
this
origin.
This
cause
would
exist
among
us
in
full
force.
We
have
a
vast
tract
of
unsettled
territory
within
the
boundaries
of
the
United
States.
There
still
are
discordant
and
undecided
claims
between
several
of
them,
and
the
dissolution
of
the
Union
would
lay
a
foundation
for
similar
claims
between
them
all.
It
is
well
known
that
they
have
heretofore
had
serious
and
animated
discussion
concerning
the
rights
to
the
lands
which
were
ungranted
at
the
time
of
the
Revolution,
and
which
usually
went
under
the
name
of
crown
lands.
The
States
within
the
limits
of
whose
colonial
governments
they
were
comprised
have
claimed
them
as
their
property,
the
others
have
contended
that
the
rights
of
the
crown
in
this
article
devolved
upon
the
Union;
especially
as
to
all
that
part
of
the
Western
territory
which,
either
by
actual
possession,
or
through
the
submission
of
the
Indian
proprietors,
was
subjected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
king
of
Great
Britain,
till
it
was
relinquished
in
the
treaty
of
peace.
This,
it
has
been
said,
was
at
all
events
an
acquisition
to
the
Confederacy
by
compact
with
a
foreign
power.
It
has
been
the
prudent
policy
of
Congress
to
appease
this
controversy,
by
prevailing
upon
the
States
to
make
cessions
to
the
United
States
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole.
This
has
been
so
far
accomplished
as,
under
a
continuation
of
the
Union,
to
afford
a
decided
prospect
of
an
amicable
termination
of
the
dispute.
A
dismemberment
of
the
Confederacy,
however,
would
revive
this
dispute,
and
would
create
others
on
the
same
subject.
At
present,
a
large
part
of
the
vacant
Western
territory
is,
by
cession
at
least,
if
not
by
any
anterior
right,
the
common
property
of
the
Union.
If
that
were
at
an
end,
the
States
which
made
the
cession,
on
a
principle
of
federal
compromise,
would
be
apt
when
the
motive
of
the
grant
had
ceased,
to
reclaim
the
lands
as
a
reversion.
The
other
States
would
no
doubt
insist
on
a
proportion,
by
right
of
representation.
Their
argument
would
be,
that
a
grant,
once
made,
could
not
be
revoked;
and
that
the
justice
of
participating
in
territory
acquired
or
secured
by
the
joint
efforts
of
the
Confederacy,
remained
undiminished.
If,
contrary
to
probability,
it
should
be
admitted
by
all
the
States,
that
each
had
a
right
to
a
share
of
this
common
stock,
there
would
still
be
a
difficulty
to
be
surmounted,
as
to
a
proper
rule
of
apportionment.
Different
principles
would
be
set
up
by
different
States
for
this
purpose;
and
as
they
would
affect
the
opposite
interests
of
the
parties,
they
might
not
easily
be
susceptible
of
a
pacific
adjustment.

In
the
wide
field
of
Western
territory,
therefore,
we
perceive
an
ample
theatre
for
hostile
pretensions,
without
any
umpire
or
common
judge
to
interpose
between
the
contending
parties.
To
reason
from
the
past
to
the
future,
we
shall
have
good
ground
to
apprehend,
that
the
sword
would
sometimes
be
appealed
to
as
the
arbiter
of
their
differences.
The
circumstances
of
the
dispute
between
Connecticut
and
Pennsylvania,
respecting
the
land
at
Wyoming,
admonish
us
not
to
be
sanguine
in
expecting
an
easy
accommodation
of
such
differences.
The
articles
of
confederation
obliged
the
parties
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
decision
of
a
federal
court.
The
submission
was
made,
and
the
court
decided
in
favor
of
Pennsylvania.
But
Connecticut
gave
strong
indications
of
dissatisfaction
with
that
determination;
nor
did
she
appear
to
be
entirely
resigned
to
it,
till,
by
negotiation
and
management,
something
like
an
equivalent
was
found
for
the
loss
she
supposed
herself
to
have
sustained.
Nothing
here
said
is
intended
to
convey
the
slightest
censure
on
the
conduct
of
that
State.
She
no
doubt
sincerely
believed
herself
to
have
been
injured
by
the
decision;
and
States,
like
individuals,
acquiesce
with
great
reluctance
in
determinations
to
their
disadvantage.

Those
who
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
inside
of
the
transactions
which
attended
the
progress
of
the
controversy
between
this
State
and
the
district
of
Vermont,
can
vouch
the
opposition
we
experienced,
as
well
from
States
not
interested
as
from
those
which
were
interested
in
the
claim;
and
can
attest
the
danger
to
which
the
peace
of
the
Confederacy
might
have
been
exposed,
had
this
State
attempted
to
assert
its
rights
by
force.
Two
motives
preponderated
in
that
opposition:
one,
a
jealousy
entertained
of
our
future
power;
and
the
other,
the
interest
of
certain
individuals
of
influence
in
the
neighboring
States,
who
had
obtained
grants
of
lands
under
the
actual
government
of
that
district.
Even
the
States
which
brought
forward
claims,
in
contradiction
to
ours,
seemed
more
solicitous
to
dismember
this
State,
than
to
establish
their
own
pretensions.
These
were
New
Hampshire,
Massachusetts,
and
Connecticut.
New
Jersey
and
Rhode
Island,
upon
all
occasions,
discovered
a
warm
zeal
for
the
independence
of
Vermont;
and
Maryland,
till
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
a
connection
between
Canada
and
that
State,
entered
deeply
into
the
same
views.
These
being
small
States,
saw
with
an
unfriendly
eye
the
perspective
of
our
growing
greatness.
In
a
review
of
these
transactions
we
may
trace
some
of
the
causes
which
would
be
likely
to
embroil
the
States
with
each
other,
if
it
should
be
their
unpropitious
destiny
to
become
disunited.

Each
State,

confederacy,
would
pursue
a
system
of

policy
peculiar

itself.
This
would
occasion
distinctions,
preferences,
and
exclusions,
which
would
beget
discontent.

intercourse,
on
the

of
equal
privileges,
to

accustomed
since

of
the

than

would
naturally
have
independent
of

The
spirit
of
enterprise,
which
characterizes
the
commercial
part
of
America,
has
left
no
occasion
of
displaying
itself
unimproved.
It
is
not
at
all
probable
that
this
unbridled
spirit
would
pay
much
respect
to
those
regulations
of
trade
by
which
particular
States
might
endeavor
to
secure
exclusive
benefits
to
their
own
citizens.
The
infractions
of
these
regulations,
on
one
side,
the
efforts
to
prevent
and
repel
them,
on
the
other,
would
naturally
lead
to
outrages,

these
to
reprisals
and

States.
The
relative
situation
of
New
York,
Connecticut,
and
New
Jersey
would
afford
an
example
of
this
kind.
New
York,
from
the
necessities
of
revenue,
must
lay
duties
on
her
importations.
A
great
part
of
these
duties
must
be
paid
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
other
States
in
the
capacity
of
consumers
of
what
we
import.
New
York
would
neither
be
willing
nor
able
to
forego
this
advantage.
Her
citizens
would
not
consent
that
a
duty
paid
by
them
should
be
remitted
in
favor
of
the
citizens
of
her
neighbors;
nor
would
it
be
practicable,
if
there
were
not
this
impediment
in
the
way,
to
distinguish
the
customers
in
our
own
markets.
Would
Connecticut
and
New
Jersey
long
submit
to
be
taxed
by
New
York
for
her
exclusive
benefit?
Should
we
be
long
permitted
to
remain
in
the
quiet
and
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
a
metropolis,
from
the
possession
of
which
we
derived
an
advantage
so
odious
to
our
neighbors,
and,
in
their
opinion,
so
oppressive?
Should
we
be
able
to
preserve
it
against
the
incumbent
weight
of
Connecticut
on
the
one
side,
and
the
co-operating
pressure
of
New
Jersey
on
the
other?
These
are
questions
that
temerity
alone
will
answer
in
the
affirmative.

of
ill-humor

satisfactory
to
all?
There
is
scarcely
any
that
can
be
proposed
which
is
entirely
free
from
real
objections.
These,
as
usual,
would
be
exaggerated
by
the
adverse
interest
of
the
parties.
There
are
even
dissimilar
views
among
the
States
as
to
the
general
principle
of
discharging
the
public
debt.
Some
of
them,
either
less
impressed
with
the
importance
of
national
credit,
or
because
their
citizens
have
little,
if
any,
immediate
interest
in
the
question,
feel
an
indifference,
if
not
a
repugnance,
to
the
payment
of
the
domestic
debt
at
any
rate.
These
would
be
inclined
to
magnify
the
difficulties
of
a
distribution.
Others
of

a
numerous
body
of
whose
citizens
are
creditors
to
the
public
beyond
proportion
of
the
State
in
the
total
amount
of
the
national
debt,
would
be
strenuous
for
some
equitable
and
effective
provision.
The
procrastinations
of
the
former
would
excite
the
resentments
of
the
latter.
The
settlement
of
a
rule
would,
in
the
meantime,
be
postponed
by
real
differences
of
opinion
and
affected
delays.
The
citizens
of

would
clamour;
foreign
powers
would
urge
for
the
satisfaction
of
their

the

Suppose
the
difficulties

Still
there
is
great
room
to
suppose
that
the
rule
agreed
upon
would,
upon
experiment,
be
found
to
bear
harder
upon
some
States
than
upon
others.
Those
which
were
sufferers
by
it
would
naturally
seek
for
a
mitigation
of
the
burden.
The
others
would
as
naturally
be
disinclined
to
a
revision,
which
was
likely
to
end
in
an
increase
of
their
own
incumbrances.
Their
refusal
would
be
too
plausible
a
pretext
to
the
complaining
States
to
withhold
their
contributions,
not
to
be
embraced
with
avidity;
and
the
non-compliance
of
these
States
with
their
engagements
would
be
a
ground
of
bitter
discussion
and
altercation.
If
even
the
rule
adopted
should
in
practice
justify
the
equality
of
its
principle,
still
delinquencies
in
payments
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
States
would
result
from
a
diversity
of
other
causes�the
real
deficiency
of
resources;
the
mismanagement
of
their
finances;
accidental
disorders
in
the
management
of
the
government;
and,
in
addition
to
the
rest,
the
reluctance
with
which
men
commonly
part
with
money
for
purposes
that
have
outlived
the
exigencies
which
produced
them,
and
interfere
with
the
supply
of
immediate
wants.
Delinquencies,
from
whatever
causes,
would
be
productive
of
complaints,
recriminations,
and
quarrels.
There
is,
perhaps,
nothing
more
likely
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
nations
than
their
being
bound
to
mutual
contributions
for
any
common
object
that
does
not
yield
an
equal
and
coincident
benefit.
For
it
is
an
observation,
as
true
as
it
is
trite,
that
there
is
nothing
men
differ
so
readily
about
as
the
payment
of

a
War
between
the
States,
in
the
first
period
of
their
separate
existence,
would
be
accompanied
with
much
greater
distresses
than
it
commonly
is
in
those
countries
where
regular
military
establishments
have
long
obtained.
The
disciplined
armies
always
kept
on
foot
on
the
continent
of
Europe,
though
they
bear
a
malignant
aspect
to
liberty
and
economy,
have,
notwithstanding,
been
productive
of
the
signal
advantage
of
rendering
sudden
conquests
impracticable,
and
of
preventing
that
rapid
desolation
which
used
to
mark
the
progress
of
war
prior
to
their
introduction.
The
art
of
fortification
has
contributed
to
the
same
ends.
The
nations
of
Europe
are
encircled
with
chains
of
fortified
places,
which
mutually
obstruct
invasion.
Campaigns
are
wasted
in
reducing
two
or
three
frontier
garrisons,
to
gain
admittance
into
an
enemy's
country.
Similar
impediments
occur
at
every
step,
to
exhaust
the
strength
and
delay
the
progress
of
an
invader.
Formerly,
an
invading
army
would
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
a
neighboring
country
almost
as
soon
as
intelligence
of
its
approach
could
be
received;
but
now
a
comparatively
small
force
of
disciplined
troops,
acting
on
the
defensive,
with
the
aid
of
posts,
is
able
to
impede,
and
finally
to
frustrate,
the
enterprises
of
one
much
more
considerable.
The
history
of
war,
in
that
quarter
of
the
globe,
is
no
longer
a
history
of
nations
subdued
and
empires
overturned,
but
of
towns
taken
and
retaken;
of
battles
that
decide
nothing;
of
retreats
more

This
picture

not

highly
wrought;
though,
I
confess,
it
would
not
long
remain
a
just
one.
Safety
from
external
danger
is
the
most
powerful
director
of
national
conduct.
Even
the
ardent
love
of
liberty
will,
after
a
time,
give
way
to
its
dictates.
The
violent
destruction
of
life
and
property
incident
to
war,
the
continual
effort
and
alarm
attendant
on
a
state
of
continual
danger,
will
compel
nations
the
most
attached
to
liberty
to
resort
for
repose
and
security
to
institutions
which
have
a
tendency
to
destroy
their
civil
and
political
rights.
To
be
more
safe,
they
at
length
become
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
being
less
free.

STANDING
ARMIES
and
the
correspondent

of
military
establishments.
Standing
armies,
it
is
said,
are
not
provided
against
in
the
new
Constitution;
and
it
is
therefore
inferred
that
they
may
exist
under
it.(1)
Their
existence,
however,
from
the
very
terms
of
the
proposition,
is,
at
most,
problematical
and
uncertain.
But
standing
armies,
it
may
be
replied,
must
inevitably
result
from
a
dissolution
of
the
Confederacy.
Frequent
war
and
constant
apprehension,
which
require
a
state
of
as
constant
preparation,
will
infallibly
produce
them.
The
weaker
States
or
confederacies
would
first
have
recourse
to
them,
to
put
themselves
upon
an
equality
with
their
more
potent
neighbors.
They
would
endeavor
to
supply
the
inferiority
of
population
and
resources
by
a
more
regular
and
effective
system
of
defense,
by
disciplined
troops,
and
by
fortifications.
They
would,
at
the
same
time,
be
necessitated
to
strengthen
the
executive
arm
of
government,
in
doing
which
their
constitutions
would
acquire
a
progressive
direction
toward
monarchy.
It
is
of
the
nature
of
war
to
increase
the
executive
at
the
expense
of
the
legislative
authority.

have

triumphed

large

greater

which
have
been
destitute

Different
answers,
equally
satisfactory,
may
be
given
to
this
question.
The
industrious
habits
of
the
people
of
the
present
day,
absorbed
in
the
pursuits
of
gain,
and
devoted
to
the
improvements
of
agriculture
and
commerce,
are
incompatible
with
the
condition
of
a
nation
of
soldiers,
which
was
the
true
condition
of
the
people
of
those
republics.
The
means
of
revenue,
which
have
been
so
greatly
multiplied
by
the
increase
of
gold
and
silver
and
of
the
arts
of
industry,
and
the
science
of
finance,
which
is
the
offspring
of
modern
times,
concurring
with
the
habits
of
nations,
have
produced
an
entire
revolution
in
the
system
of
war,

There
is
a
wide
difference,
also,
between
military
establishments
in
a
country
seldom
exposed
by
its
situation
to
internal
invasions,
and
in
one
which
is
often
subject
to
them,
and
always
apprehensive
of
them.
The
rulers
of
the
former
can
have
no
good
pretext,
if
they
are
even
so
inclined,
to
keep
on
foot
armies
so
numerous
as
must
of
necessity
be
maintained
in
the
latter.
These
armies
being,
in
the
first
case,
rarely,
if
at
all,
called
into
activity
for
interior
defense,
the
people
are
in
no
danger
of
being
broken
to
military
subordination.
The
laws
are
not
accustomed
to
relaxations,
in
favor
of
military
exigencies;
the
civil
state
remains
in
full
vigor,
neither
corrupted,
nor
confounded
with
the
principles
or
propensities
of
the
other
state.
The
smallness
of
the
army
renders
the
natural
strength
of
the
community
an
overmatch
for
it;
and
the
citizens,
not
habituated
to
look
up
to
the
military
power
for
protection,
or
to
submit
to
its
oppressions,
neither
love
nor
fear
the
soldiery;
they
view
them
with
a
spirit
of
jealous
acquiescence
in
a
necessary
evil,
and
stand
ready
to
resist
a
power
which
they
suppose
may
be
exerted
to
the
prejudice
of
their
rights.

The
continual
necessity
for
their
services
enhances
the
importance
of
the
soldier,
and
proportionably
degrades
the
condition
of
the
citizen.
The
military
state
becomes
elevated
above
the
civil.
The
inhabitants
of
territories,
often
the
theatre
of
war,
are
unavoidably
subjected
to
frequent
infringements
on
their
rights,
which
serve
to
weaken
their
sense
of
those
rights;
and
by
degrees
the
people
are
brought
to
consider
the
soldiery
not
only
as
their
protectors,
but
as
their
superiors.
The
transition
from
this
disposition
to
that
of
considering
them
masters,
is
neither
remote
nor
difficult;
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
prevail
upon
a
people
under
such
impressions,
to
make
a
bold
or
effectual
resistance
to
usurpations
supported
by
the
military
power.

The
kingdom
of
Great
Britain
falls
within
the
first
description.
An
insular
situation,
and
a
powerful
marine,
guarding
it
in
a
great
measure
against
the
possibility
of
foreign
invasion,
supersede
the
necessity
of
a
numerous
army
within
the
kingdom.
A
sufficient
force
to
make
head
against
a
sudden
descent,
till
the
militia
could
have
time
to
rally
and
embody,
is
all
that
has
been
deemed
requisite.
No
motive
of
national
policy
has
demanded,
nor
would
public
opinion
have
tolerated,
a
larger
number
of
troops
upon
its
domestic
establishment.
There
has
been,
for
a
long
time
past,
little
room
for
the
operation
of
the
other
causes,
which
have
been
enumerated
as
the
consequences
of
internal
war.
This
peculiar
felicity
of
situation
has,
in
a
great
degree,
contributed
to
preserve
the
liberty
which
that
country
to
this
day
enjoys,
in
spite
of
the
prevalent
venality
and
corruption.
If,
on
the
contrary,
Britain
had
been
situated
on
the
continent,
and
had
been
compelled,
as
she
would
have
been,
by
that
situation,
to
make
her
military
establishments
at
home
coextensive
with
those
of
the
other
great
powers
of
Europe,
she,
like
them,
would
in
all
probability
be,
at
this
day,
a
victim
to
the
absolute
power
of
a
single
man.
It
is
possible,
though
not
easy,
that
the
people
of
that
island
may
be
enslaved
from
other
causes;
but
it
cannot
be
by
the
prowess
of
an
army
so
inconsiderable

that
which
has

usually
kept

the
kingdom.

This
is
an
idea
not
superficial
or
futile,
but
solid
and
weighty.
It
deserves
the
most
serious
and
mature
consideration
of
every
prudent
and
honest
man
of
whatever
party.
If
such
men
will
make
a
firm
and
solemn
pause,
and
meditate
dispassionately
on
the
importance
of
this
interesting
idea;
if
they
will
contemplate
it
in
all
its
attitudes,
and
trace
it
to
all
its
consequences,
they
will
not
hesitate
to
part
with
trivial
objections
to
a
Constitution,
the
rejection
of
which
would
in
all
probability
put
a
final
period
to
the
Union.
The
airy
phantoms
that
flit
before
the
distempered
imaginations
of
some
of
its
adversaries
would
quickly
give
place
to
the
more
substantial
forms
of
dangers,
real,
certain,
and
formidable.
